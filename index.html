                    <p>I just wanted you to know how pleased I am with the job you did refinishing my front door. It looks
                    wonderful! Prior to hearing about your company, I spent months shopping for a new door. My refinished 
                    door looks better than any of the new doors I looked at and for a fraction of the price.</p>

                    <p>...the two men who refinished the door were extremely professional and knowledgeable.</p>
